# Overview

Multiplayer, or multiuser, allows multiple users to participate simultaneously in the same environment.

In video games, multiplayer allows players to either compete or cooperate with others in real-time. It makes games more social and dynamic by adding interaction between players.

In simulation and training, multiplayer is used to let multiple people practice real-life scenarios together. It helps create realistic situations where users can learn and improve their skills.

UltimateXR fully supports multiplayer by providing an architecture that can sync all its components between users seamlessly. It works with any of today's popular multiplayer solutions, such as:
- [Unity NetCode](https://docs-multiplayer.unity3d.com/netcode/current/about/)
- [Photon Fusion](https://www.photonengine.com/fusion)
- [FishNet](https://fish-networking.gitbook.io/docs)
- [Mirror](https://mirror-networking.com/)
- [Dissonance](https://placeholder-software.co.uk/dissonance/docs/index.html) and [Photon Voice](https://www.photonengine.com/voice) (voice over network).

# How does it work?

For a more technical overview, check the [Technical Overview](/docs/multiplayer/technical-overview) section.

UltimateXR is capable of providing multiplayer support out-of-the-box with a few clicks, making it ideal for quick prototyping and indie projects.

For larger projects, where custom multiplayer code is required, UltimateXR has a simple yet powerful API that works with any the supported multiplayer systems. This API has the additional benefit of providing state-saving and replay support seamlessly. New multiplayer system integrations will also work automatically.

Users can also keep using native multiplayer code if preferred.
