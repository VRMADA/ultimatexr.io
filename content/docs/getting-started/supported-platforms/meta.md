# Meta Quest

## Installing and setting up Meta Quest support

To begin setting up Meta Quest support, open the UltimateXR SDK Manager using the menu `Tools -> UltimateXR -> SDKs -> SDK Manager`.

Next, click on "Get SDK" under the Meta section. This will open the link to add the Meta XR Core SDK to your assets. Here is how that looks:

Having done that, please return to Unity and open the Package Manager using the menu `Window -> Package Manager`.

In this window select “My Assets” from the top drop-down menu as displayed.

Now create the .apk file for Android using `File -> Build Settings -> Build`

Note: Build and run may give shader errors on some configurations. If this is the case, use Build instead and use adb -install file.apk to install it on your device.
