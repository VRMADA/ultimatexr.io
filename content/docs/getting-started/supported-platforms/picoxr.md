Download and unzip the package to a folder. If you are using versioning software you may want to unzip the package to a folder under version control, while keeping it outside of the project’s Assets folder. This will make sure the package is available to all users.

Go to the Unity Package Manager using the menu Window -> Package Manager. Click on the + and select Add package from disk…

Your application should now be compatible with the Pico headset and controllers.
To be able to use Play Mode to preview the scene in Unity, and not just create Pico-compatible builds, you will need to install the Pico Developer Center (PDC).
To install the PDC follow [these instructions](https://developer-global.pico-interactive.com/document/unity/pdc-basic-info).
