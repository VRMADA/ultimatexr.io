# Overview

UltimateXR is a framework carefully designed with ease of use and scalability at its core. Mastering the entirity of the framework may require some time and dedication.

This programming guide serves as a comprehensive resource for programmers exploring the framework's capabilities. It covers a range of topics crucial for both novice and experienced users.

For beginners, sections like Input and UI interaction describe essential functionalities for starting out. Moving to intermediate levels, topics such as Manipulation go a little deeper, describing functionality to interact with virtual objects. These concepts requires a solid understanding of C#, including event handling and method overriding.

State Serialization and Synchronization enable seamless integration with UltimateXR's powerful multiplayer, statesave, and replay functionalities. This topic requires a deeper level of expertise to explore its full capabilities.

Of particular interest is the "How Do I...?" section, which provides a collection of code snippets for common daily tasks.
