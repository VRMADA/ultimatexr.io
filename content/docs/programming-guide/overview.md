# Overview

UltimateXR is a framework carefully designed with ease of use and scalability as its fundamental goals. Mastering the entirity of the framework may require some time and dedication.

This programming guide serves as a comprehensive resource for programmers exploring the framework's capabilities. It covers a range of topics crucial for both novice and experienced users.

For beginners, sections like [Input](/docs/programming-guide/input-getting-user-input) and [UI Interaction](/docs/programming-guide/ui-interaction-overview) describe essential functionalities for starting out. Moving to intermediate levels, topics such as [Manipulation](/docs/programming-guide/manipulation-overview) go a little deeper, describing functionality to interact with virtual objects. These concepts requires a solid understanding of C#, including event handling and method overriding.

[State Serialization and Synchronization](/docs/programming-guide/state-serialization-and-synchronization-introduction) enable seamless integration with UltimateXR's powerful multiplayer, statesave, and replay functionalities. This topic requires a deeper level of expertise to explore its full capabilities.

Of particular interest is the [How do I...?](/docs/programming-guide/how-do-i) section, which provides a collection of code snippets for common daily tasks.
