# Haptics

Haptic impulses, in the context of VR controllers, refer to tactile feedback generated by the controller to simulate the sensation of touch or force feedback. These impulses are typically generated through small motors or actuators embedded within the controller, which produce vibrations or pulses that can be felt by the user. Haptic impulses are used to enhance immersion and provide users with physical feedback in virtual environments, such as when interacting with virtual objects.
