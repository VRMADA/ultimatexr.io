# UxrGrabManager

## Introduction
`UxrGrabManager` is the central class managing manipulation interactions in UltimateXR. It is responsible for updating all manipulation-related components each frame.

This guide will show you how to program using the `UxrGrabManager`. While the manager provides standard grab mechanics automatically, allowing avatars to interact with the environment through manipulation components, programming can be used for additional tasks such as:
- Writing code that reacts to manipulation events.
- Querying information about current grabs.
- Executing actions like grabbing, releasing, or placing objects programmatically.

These are just a few examples. Below, we will list all the functionality that `UxrGrabManager` provides.

## Singleton
`UxrGrabManager` is a [singleton](/docs/programming-guide/architecture/singletons) that is created automatically during startup. The global instance can be accessed from anywhere in the code through `UxrGrabManager.Instance:full`.

## Core Responsibilities
At runtime, `UxrGrabManager` monitors input events and reacts to user actions like grabbing or releasing objects. These interactions are handled automatically with the help of other components such as:
- [UxrGrabber](/docs/programming-guide/manipulation/uxrgrabber): Component on avatar hands that enable grabbing.
- [UxrGrabbableObject](/docs/programming-guide/manipulation/uxrgrabbableobject): Component added to objects enabling grabbing and describing how.
- [UxrGrabbableObjectAnchor](/docs/programming-guide/manipulation/uxrgrabbableobjectanchor): Component on points in space where objects can be snapped to.

The managerâ€™s responsibilities include:
- **Tracking manipulation components**: Monitoring all grabbers, grabbable objects, and anchors in the scene.
- **Handling interactions**: Managing actions like grabbing, placing objects on anchors, releasing, and throwing.
- **Applying constraints**: Enforcing limits on object movement and rotation.
- **Ensuring smooth transitions**: Performing manipulation actions with smooth, glitch-free movements.
- **Updating affordances**: Maintaining visual cues that show how objects can be interacted with.
- **Raising events**: Notifying users of key actions to enable custom reactions.
- **Syncing manipulation**: Ensuring consistency in multiplayer sessions.

## Events
`UxrGrabManager` provides several key events to track object interactions. Refer to the [Events](/docs/programming-guide/manipulation/events#uxrgrabmanagerdocsprogramming-guidemanipulationuxrgrabmanager-events) guide for more information

## Properties

### Features

The `UxrGrabManager.Features` property, which uses the `UxrManipulationFeatures` flags, allows control over which manipulation features are enabled during object interaction. By configuring this property, you can toggle specific features such as object constraints, smooth transitions, affordances, and more.

- **ObjectManipulation**: Updates the transform of `UxrGrabbableObject` based on user interaction.
- **ObjectConstraints**: Applies constraints set in the `UxrGrabbableObject` component.
- **ObjectResistance**: Adds resistance for translation and rotation.
- **UserConstraints**: Handles custom constraints defined by the user.
- **KeepGripsInPlace**: Prevents hand drift when constraints are applied.
- **SmoothTransitions**: Ensures smooth transitions during manipulation.
- **Affordances**: Updates object interaction cues.
- **All**: Enables all features.

By default, all features are enabled.
