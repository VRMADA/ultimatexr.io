# Events

UltimateXR provides an event-based system for its manipulation module that allows developers to respond to specific actions and interactions. These events can be tied to grabbing, releasing, or interacting with objects, giving you full control over how your application reacts to them.

You can access these events in two ways: 

1. **Using `UxrGrabManager`**: This lets you track all object interactions.
2. **Directly from a `UxrGrabbableObject` or `UxrGrabbableObjectAnchor`**: Use this when you only need to track events for a specific object.

Weâ€™ll also cover `UxrGrabbableObjectComponent`, which allows you to handle events by overriding specific methods through inheritance.
