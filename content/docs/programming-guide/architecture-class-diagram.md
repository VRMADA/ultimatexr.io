## Overview

The primary component class in UltimateXR is `UxrComponent`, which inherits from Unity's `MonoBehaviour`. All components within UltimateXR are derived from `UxrComponent`.

UxrComponent provides essential functionality used throughout the framework:

- Each component is assigned a unique identifier during its whole life cycle.
- Component changes can be synchronized automatically in multiplayer sessions. 
- Component changes can also be automatically recorded in replays.
- The runtime state of all components in the scene can be output to save files.
- All active components, or from a specific type, can be enumerated from any point in the application.

Additionally, `UxrComponent` offers quick access to commonly used utilities to simplify development.

Users can incorporate this functionality into their own components by inheriting from UxrComponent rather than MonoBehaviour.
